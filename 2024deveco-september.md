# devEco September, 2024 - Update

## Intro
The devEco is an open, honest, and transparent community intent on doing things the right way. One way to do this, is by providing our members with useful data that can be used to help us grow. 

Your integrity and the integrity of our community is of the utmost importance. Share and invite with confidence!

If there is a metric you would like included in future reports, please drop your suggetion in the <#1280075675604221984> channel.

NOTE: Since the relaunch of our community (in last August), there are not many data points to share. As we grow, we plan to include Growth, Activation, and Engagement metrics. This report will serve as our floor. The direction to go from here is UP!

**Metrics**:
- **TOTAL MEMBERS**: 2,302
- **TOTAL ESTIMATED ACTIVE MEMBERS (MAU - ACROSS DISCORD)**: 889
- **MEMBERS SUBJECT TO PRUNING**: 1,413
-  **EXPECTED PRUNE RATE Q3, 2024**: 61.3%

## Conclusion
Our once vibrant and engaging community went into hibernation almost 5 years ago, and in this time we appear to have lost quite a few members. While we are unsure where these members have gone, we are confident in our ability to win them back (with their friends :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:). Still, we are more than happy to celebrate our 889 active Discord members and look forward to working with you to make this server your go to place for developer activities and discussion. While growth is important, it is not everything! Instead, we are focused on providing value, respect, and opportunity to be a part of something much bigger than any one of us. Numbers will come in time, and the devCore are working hard to identify organic growth opportunities. We will of course share more information as they develop. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about your community! Please feel free to reach out any time!
